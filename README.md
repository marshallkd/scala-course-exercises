Solutions from Martin Odersky's Coursera course on functional programming in Scala

## README

I have been using Scala mostly in the framework of Spark, but recently have decided to develop a more thorough
background in functional programming principles with Scala. I will be going through the exercises in the Coursera
course, Functional Programming Principles In Scala by Martin Odersky (https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
and trying to solve them on my own using this repo as a backup and reference for myself.
